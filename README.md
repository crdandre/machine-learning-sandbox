# deep-learning-sandbox
Documenting my learning in various machine learning techniques.

Each repository I work with is duplicated in this repository, in the state in which it existed at the time of my cloning it. In some cases, I modify the code to try to adapt it to various purposes, so while this leads to some code redundancy, it makes it more likely you can duplicate my path.

To learn a topic, you can try to work with the repositories in the same order I did, and extract the same lessons. Everything here within a model type is listed in the order of experimentation.
